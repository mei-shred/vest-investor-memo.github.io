   - AI replacing human financial advisors
   - Automated processes for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting

3. **Arbitrage in Transaction Costs**:
   VEST charges 0.5% per transaction while actual costs are much lower (as low as 0.00032% for volume-based charges). This creates a significant profit margin while still offering value to customers compared to traditional wealth management fees.

4. **Network Effects in AI Performance**:
   As more users join and interact with the platform, the AI's ability to generate and optimize strategies improves, creating a flywheel of better performance and user attraction.
