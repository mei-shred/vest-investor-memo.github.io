## Traction
- 1241 waitlist sign-ups in 28 Days
- Pilot with 87 users
- Partnerships Secured: 1. Brokerage for platform launch; 2. Wealth management firm for white glove services
- Investment advisory license obtained

## Market
- TAM: $5.4 billion
- Indian Mutual Fund AUM: $733 billion (June 2024)
- Demat accounts: 151 million (2024), up from 40 million in 2020
- Target: HENRY investors ($12k+ annual income), fastest-growing segment

### Business Model
1. 0.5% flat fee per transaction
2. Freemium subscriptions for advanced features
3. White glove services with certified wealth managers

### Bottom-up Market Sizing:
- 151 million demat account holders
- Average investment: $6,000 per user
- Potential revenue streams:
  1. Flat fee: 151M * $6K * 0.5% = ~$4.6 billion
  2. Freemium subscriptions: 15.1M * $25 = ~$377 million
  3. White Glove Services: 1.51M * $140 = ~$211 million

## Unique Insights

1. **Wealth Management Functions at Brokerage Costs**: 
   VEST combines the sophisticated functions of a wealth management firm (personalized portfolios, tax optimization, access to premium vehicles) with the cost structure of a digital brokerage. This is possible due to:
   - AI replacing human financial advisors
   - Automated processes for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting
   - Direct indexing eliminating fund management costs

2. **Outsourcing Intelligence**:
   Instead of maintaining costly in-house research teams, VEST leverages:
   - AI for personalized strategy generation
   - Existing market indices and top-performing portfolios
   - User insights for alpha generation

3. **Arbitrage in Transaction Costs**:
   VEST charges 0.5% per transaction while actual costs are much lower (as low as 0.00032% for volume-based charges). This creates a significant profit margin while still offering value to customers compared to traditional wealth management fees.

4. **Network Effects in AI Performance**:
   As more users join and interact with the platform, the AI's ability to generate and optimize strategies improves, creating a flywheel of better performance and user attraction.

5. **Automating TLH and Lack of Direct Indexing Saturation in India**:
   No current competitor in India offers Automated Tax Loss Harvesting. Direct Indexing is a very relatively new phenomenon in India. India's lack of a wash sale rule makes the combination of these two incredibly effective at increasing returns over standard index ETFs.
